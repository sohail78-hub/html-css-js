# is JavaScript works in  Classes or OOPs

- JavaScript is Prototype Language. And also using classess or OOPs somewhat but underhoot in JavaScript ProtoType.

# OOP
- OOP is a program Paradime.

# Object
- Object is a collection of properties and methods.
- toLowerCase()
- Promise

## Why use OOP
- can make Service

## Parts of OOP
- Object literal (Object properites, length)

- Construction Function
- Prototypes
- Instances (new, this)

# 4 Pillars in OOPs

These principles allow objects to communicate and work together to create applications. 

1. Abstraction
(Abstraction is a process of hiding implementation details and exposing only the functionality to the user. In abstraction, we deal with ideas and not events. This means the user will only know “what it does” rather than “how it does”.)

2. Encapsulation 
(Wrapup function, data or Hides away some of the details of an object while still allowing others to access it. This helps to keep code modular and maintainable. )

3. Inheritance
(Allows an object to inherit properties and methods from another object. This helps to create reusable code.)

4. Polymorphism 
(Allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. This helps to create flexible and extensible code.) Polymorphism is the ability to perform many things in many ways. The word Polymorphism is from two different Greek words- poly and morphs. “Poly” means many, and “Morphs” means forms. So polymorphism means many forms. The polymorphism can be present in the case of inheritance also. The functions behave differently based on the actual implementation.
